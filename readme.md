# OpenGoles

OpenGoles is an app based on the API from Goles [Messenger app](https://itunes.apple.com/es/app/goles-messenger-alertas-instantaneas/id546611684?mt=8).

I developed this app because Goles Messenger doesn't have an Apple Watch app, so I decided to create this app to create an Apple Watch app at the same time that I learn Swift.

You can see an example of the Apple Watch app [here](https://twitter.com/alberto__segura/status/793187018037755904).
